## 30 days of MooTools

30 days of MooTools is a collection of tutorials to learn to use the MooTools javascrit library, first published in 2008 by [ConsiderOpen](http://www.consideropen.com).
		
As the original website is currently offline, the tutorials have been collected using the [Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/20090212090700/http://www.consideropen.com/blog/tag/30-days-of-mootools) to make them available to everyone interested in learning to use MooTools.
		
As the original tutorials were based on MooTools 1.2, some parts could be at the moment outdated or not working correctly. Part of the project is therefore to update and expand the tutorials based on the latest MooTools versions.

The copyright (and gratitude) for the original lessons is hold by [ConsiderOpen](http://www.consideropen.com).

**NOTE:** The original lessons are actually 23, as they where interrupted after this day.
